# ReactJS Tutorial

This GitHub Repository is based on one and only one tutorial:.

For now, I am going to list a few projects. I am going to start one and if I feel that it isn't worth doing I will try the next. This will be deleted in the future once I choose which tutorial project to go with.
- [React Personal Portfolio Website - Code and Deploy A React Portfolio](https://youtu.be/x7mwVn2z3Sk)
- [Build and Deploy a React Admin Dashboard App With Theming, Tables, Charts, Calendar, Kanban and More](https://youtu.be/jx5hdo50a2M)
- [React Portfolio Website Tutorial | Responsive React Project Full Course for Beginners](https://youtu.be/7WwtzsSHdpI)


This project was started for myself to learn the basics of React. Throughout the tutorial, I added personal notes to a file called "trevors-log.txt" which contains nearly everything I did including terminal commands. It's fairly unorganized and probably not useful for anyone except myself. However, in case I need to reference something in the future, I have that file.
